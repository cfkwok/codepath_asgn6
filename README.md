# Project 6 - Globitek Authentication and Login Throttling

Time spent: 5 hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

1\. "staff/users/new.php" and "staff/users/edit.php"
  * [x]  Form with inputs for "Password" and "Confirm Password"
  * [x]  Strong password requirements text

2\. Data validations
  * [x]  Returns an error if password or confirm_password are blank.
  * [x]  Returns an error if password and confirm_password do not match.
  * [x]  Returns an error if password is not at least 12 characters long.
  * [x]  Returns an error if password does not meet character requirements.
  * [x]  Returns any errors related to other validations already on the user.

3\. Saving a user
  * [x]  Encrypts the password
  * [x]  Stores the password in the database

4\. Login page
  * [x]  Verify the correct password.
  * [x]  Do not create a User Enumeration vulnerability.

5\. If a user fails to log in:
  * [x]  Record the failed login for the first 5 attempts.
  * [x]  Return a "too many failed logins" message after 5 attempts.
  * [x]  Future attempts will show the number of minutes remaining in the lockout.
  * [x]  After the lockout period, the failed logins count resets to 0.

6\. After any successful login:
  * [x]  Set the failed_logins.count for the username to 0.

7\. SQLi and XSS
  * [x]  Do not introduce any SQLI Injection and Cross-Site Scripting vulnerabilities.

The following advanced user stories are optional:

* Bonus Objective 1\.
  * [ ]  Identify the subtle Username Enumeration weakness. Include a short description of how the code could be modified to be more secure below:

* Bonus Objective 2\.
  * [ ]  User password validations only run when the password is not blank.
  * [ ]  `update_user` only encrypts and updates the password when the password is not blank.

* Bonus Objective 3\.
  * [ ]  Create a new user using cost 10.
  * [ ]  Set bcrypt "cost" parameter to 11 (for both insert and update).
  * [ ]  Try to login with the "cost 10" user.
  * [ ]  Briefly describe why login still works even after the cost is changed:

* Bonus Objective 4\.
  * [ ]  Add "Previous password" to "public/staff/users/edit.php"
  * [ ]  Validate the previous password before allowing the password to be updated.
  * [ ]  Require previous password only if new password is being updated (if also completing Bonus Objective 2).

* Advanced Objective 1\.
  * [ ]  Implement `password_hash()` on your own as `my_password_hash()`.
  * [ ]  Implement `password_verify()` on your own as `my_password_verify()`.

* Advanced Objective 2\.
  * [ ]  Write `generate_strong_password()`
  * [ ]  Add a suggestion for a 12-character strong password to the new and edit user pages.
